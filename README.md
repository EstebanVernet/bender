# Bender: A hexadecimal editor for databending

## Introduction

This tool is an enhanced hexadecimal editor used for creating glitched images. It provides simple features that make the bending process easier and faster.

## Features

Here is what is available for now:
- Edit any image source code (unless its format isn't supported by your browser)
- View the result of your modifications in a side view, without the need for another software to open the file
- Track every version of your altered file with the history
- Roll back to any version using the history
- Color codes for modified characters (the modified data is compared to the original image's data)
- Highlight character coordinates using an image from the history
- Save images in a non-glitched format for use in any image editing software

## Setup

You can use the app on my website: [https://estebanver.net/experiences/bender](https://estebanver.net/experiences/bender)  
Alternatively, if you want to create your own version of the tool, you can clone this repository and open the HTML file (it should work even if you're not running a local server).
